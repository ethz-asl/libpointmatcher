 * libpointmatcher.  However, this method is easy to understand, and (due to its

 * As with the \ref generatePointCloud method, this method is not to be taken as
 * an authoritative way of computing normals.  It is one of many options in this
 * domain, and exists only to demonstrate how you can coordinate externally
 * computed normals with libpointmatcher.
 *
 * \remark
 *     Though you could be more clever with the borders in this method, the
 *     implementation here deliberately sets the borders to be NaN to show how
 *     the NaN Filter for libpointmatcher behaves -- all positions are valid (no
 *     NaN), but the normals need to get filtered.  Libpointmatcher will handle
 *     this (and all other descriptors) correctly for you.

	 * frame.  In the context of your own application, this would be where you

	 * normals, now you just need a way of interfacing with libpointmatcher.
	 *
	 * We utilize the Eigen::Map for these purposes, but it is important to
	 * understand that you need to have a firm understanding of how your data
	 * is laid out, and what the expectations of libpointmatcher are.
	 *
	 *     http://libpointmatcher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Pointclouds/#features-matrix
	 *
	 * Libpoint matcher expects data laid out in rows:
	 *
	 *     +-                       -+
	 *     | x_0  ...  x_i  ...  x_n |
	 *     | y_0  ...  y_i  ...  y_n |
	 *     | z_0  ...  z_i  ...  z_n |
	 *     | w_0  ...  w_i  ...  w_n |
	 *     +-                       -+
	 *
	 * Above, we allocated data as an "array of structs", laid out as
	 *
	 *     +-                  -+
	 *     | x_0  y_0  z_0  w_0 |
	 *     |  .    .    .    .  |
	 *     | x_i  y_i  z_i  w_i |
	 *     |  .    .    .    .  |
	 *     | x_n  y_n  z_n  w_n |
	 *     +-                  -+
	 *
	 * So our data should be thought of as row major storage.  As it turns out,
	 * though, this is perfectly acceptable *ONLY* because when we do a map with
	 * Eigen, Eigen by default assumes column major storage.  So when we map
	 * using 4 rows and N columns, this all works out in the end.
	 *
	 * Similarly, with the normals, we employ the same mapping scheme.  In this
	 * example code, we are also using `float4` for the normals for
	 * demonstrative purposes.  In your own application, you may or may not need
	 * the extra `w` component.  If not, you can simply use a `float3` or
	 * `Eigen::Vector3f` etc.  In the example below, since we have this `w`
	 * component, we need to take one extra step and effectively just ignore `w`
	 * as far as libpointmatcher is concerned.  This is why we use `topRows(3)`:
	 * libpointmatcher expects "normals" to be laid out as <nx, ny, nz>.  Since
	 * our mapped type will have row 0 as x, row 1 as y, row 2 as z, and row 3
	 * as w, we simply want the top three rows.
